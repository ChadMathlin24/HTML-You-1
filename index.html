<p>I began my journey at Medgar Evers college, where I am now a senior scholar graduating with a BS in Computer Info Sys.
    It seems as just yesterday i started and could not wait for it to be over. But now this is becoming bittersweet.
     Medgar Evers has revealed so much about myself and although the road has been bumpy my appreciation is forever.
    This chapter in my life will soon close and it's one that will always remind me of who I am.</p>
