<p>I began my journey at Medgar Evers college, where i am now a senior scholar, soon to be graduate with a BS in Computer Info Sys.
    <br>It seems as just yesterday i started and could not wait for it to be over, now it's becoming bittersweet.<br>
     Medgar Evers has revealed so much about myself and although the road has been bumpy my appreciation is forever.<br>
    This chapter in my life will soon close and it's one that will always remind me of who i am.</p>
