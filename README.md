<p> I began my journey at Medgar Evers college, where I am now a senior scholar graduating with a BS in Computer Info Sys.</p>
<p> It seems as just yesterday i started and could not wait for it to be over. But now this is becoming bittersweet</p>
<p> Medgar Evers has revealed so much about myself and although the road has been bumpy my appreciation is forever.</p>
<p> This chapter in my life will soon close and it's one that will always remind me of who I am.</p>
